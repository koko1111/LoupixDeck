/// Two independent version axes:

/// written with (<c>LoupedeckConfig.CurrentVersion</c>). The config migrators operate on a whole
/// config root and cannot be applied to a subtree, so an older value is only a warning (every
/// field added since is additive with a working default) and a newer value is refused.</item>
/// </list>
/// Adding a field to this class is backward compatible in both directions and needs no version
/// bump: Newtonsoft ignores unknown members when reading, and an older host simply drops the
