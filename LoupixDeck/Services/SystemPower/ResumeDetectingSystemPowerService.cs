/// dbus-monitor is unavailable. Without a resume event nothing re-establishes the link
/// after wake and the device just stays dark (issue #195).
///
/// The detection is deliberately dumb: a timer that ticks every few seconds cannot tick
/// while the host is suspended, so a tick that arrives far later than scheduled means
/// wall-clock time passed without us running — i.e. the machine was asleep. A resume the
/// platform service already reported is not reported a second time.
