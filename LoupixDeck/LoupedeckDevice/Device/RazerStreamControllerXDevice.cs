/// Razer Stream Controller X — fifteen physical keys in a 5x3 grid over a single 480x270
/// panel. No knobs, no LED buttons, no side strips, no haptic motor, and crucially no
/// touchscreen: the keys report as BUTTON_PRESS, not as TOUCH frames.
///
/// The wire protocol is identical to the Loupedeck Live S — same handshake, same
/// FRAMEBUFF/DRAW opcodes, same "\0M" display id, same 256000 baud. What differs is the
/// panel: rows 270..287 can be addressed but never reach the glass, and a FRAMEBUFF larger
/// than one full 480x270 frame is acknowledged and then dropped (see
/// <see cref="MaxFramebufferPayloadBytes"/>). Both were measured on hardware — a 480x288
/// full-panel write showed nothing at all, while the same image split into 480x270 + 480x18
/// appeared with the second band nowhere to be seen.
///
/// Because the application consumes touches everywhere, each key press is translated into a
/// synthetic touch at the centre of that key (see
/// <see cref="LoupedeckDevice.TryGetPhysicalKeySlot"/>) rather than reworking that pipeline.
/// This mirrors the reference implementation at https://github.com/foxxyz/loupedeck.
