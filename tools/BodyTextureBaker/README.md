# BodyTextureBaker

Regenerates the device body images from matte source textures — one per device
model and app theme. The textures are generic matte surfaces (grain + lighting
only), so the same two textures drive every model; only the baked-in body
geometry (viewBox + rounded-rect) differs per variant.

| Variant       | Source texture          | Output SVG                            |
|---------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `dark`        | `texture-no-light.png`  | `Assets/loupedeck-gehaeuse.svg`       |
| `light`       | `texture-light.png`     | `Assets/loupedeck-gehaeuse-light.svg` |
| `razer-dark`  | `texture-no-light.png`  | `Assets/razer-gehaeuse.svg`           |
| `razer-light` | `texture-light.png`     | `Assets/razer-gehaeuse-light.svg`     |
| `razer-x-dark`  | `texture-no-light.png` | `Assets/razer-x-gehaeuse.svg`       |
| `razer-x-light` | `texture-light.png`    | `Assets/razer-x-gehaeuse-light.svg` |

Geometry per model (SVG viewBox units, matching the AXAML overlay):

| Model | viewBox   | body rect                        | corner r |
|-------|-----------|----------------------------------|----------|
| Live S | 900×540  | (75,75)–(825,495) = 750×420      | 60       |
| Razer  | 900×600  | (75,60)–(825,540) = 750×480      | 55       |
| Razer X | 720x520  | (46,42)-(674,478) = 628x436      | 44       |

The device layouts bind the body SVG to the theme-aware `DeviceBodySvgPath`
resource (defined per `ThemeVariant` in `App.axaml`), so Light mode shows the
light body and Dark mode the dark one.

Group selectors: `--variant both` (Live S dark+light), `razer` (Razer dark+light),
`razer-x` (Razer X dark+light), `all` (every variant).

The Razer X body is laid out from the panel outwards, because the device is a
screen and nothing else: the 480x288 key grid sits at (120,116), the bezel clears
it by 22 on every side, and the body clears the bezel by 52 on every side. All
three are concentric and the margins are even all round - there is no dial column
or LED row to make one edge deeper.

## Why baking instead of SVG gradients

Skia renders SVG radial gradients in 8-bit **without dithering**, so a smooth
sheen/vignette gradient bands visibly on the device body. This tool bakes the
whole surface — dark texture **plus** lighting — into one 8-bit grayscale image
using **Floyd-Steinberg** error diffusion. The dithered image is the band-free
representation and stays band-free at every display scale (including HiDPI),
because up-scaling averages the dither back toward the true value. The output SVG
contains only that baked image (clipped to the rounded body, with an outer drop
shadow) and **no SVG gradients**, so nothing can band.

## Usage

Run from anywhere in the repo (the tool locates the repo root via
`LoupixDeck.csproj`):

```bash
# Regenerate both Live S variants with the committed defaults
dotnet run --project tools/BodyTextureBaker

# Bake the Razer variants (dark + light), or every variant
dotnet run --project tools/BodyTextureBaker -- --variant razer
dotnet run --project tools/BodyTextureBaker -- --variant all

# Bake just one variant
dotnet run --project tools/BodyTextureBaker -- --variant light

# Tweak the look of a single variant
dotnet run --project tools/BodyTextureBaker -- --variant dark --grain 0.35 --dark 0.55
```

After running, rebuild the app to pick up the new `Assets/loupedeck-gehaeuse*.svg`.

## Options

| Option      | Default            | Meaning                                                  |
|-------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `--variant` | `both`             | Which variant(s) to bake: `dark`, `light`, or `both`.    |
| `--input`   | per-variant texture (next to the tool) | Source matte texture (needs a single `--variant`). |
| `--output`  | per-variant SVG under `<repo>/Assets`  | SVG to write (needs a single `--variant`).         |
| `--width`   | `1100`             | Baked image width in px (height derived from the 750×420 body). |
| `--dark`    | `0.6` dark / `0.92` light | Brightness multiplier (lower = darker).           |
| `--grain`   | `0.5`              | Grain contrast (1 = full texture grain, 0 = smooth).     |

The defaults reproduce the committed SVGs. The Light variant keeps the white
texture bright (`--dark 0.92`) and internally softens the vignette/sheen so the
light body does not read as dirty or blown out; the Dark variant uses the matte
black texture with the original lighting.

## Changing the texture

Drop a replacement `texture-no-light.png` (dark body) or `texture-light.png`
(light body) into this folder — a flat, evenly-lit matte texture works best, as
the lighting is added by the baker, so the source should **not** have baked-in
lighting — then re-run the tool. `texture.png` is the original dark variant that
already has lighting baked in; it is kept here for reference only and is not used
by the default pipeline.

The source textures live here (not in `Assets/`) on purpose: everything under
`Assets/**` is embedded into the app binary as an Avalonia resource, and the
multi-megabyte source PNGs do not belong in the shipped app — only the small
baked SVG does.
